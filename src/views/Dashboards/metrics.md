# **📊 AI Project Dashboard Metrics**

This document outlines the key performance metrics for tracking the effectiveness of the AI system across **audio transcription, language translation, automatic case triage, and data science models**.

## **1️⃣ Audio Transcription Metrics 🎙️**

These metrics assess the accuracy and efficiency of the transcription system.

### **🔹 Word Error Rate (WER)**

* Measures how accurately spoken words are transcribed.  
* Formula: WER=Substitutions+Insertions+DeletionsTotalWordsinReferenceWER \= \\frac{{Substitutions \+ Insertions \+ Deletions}}{{Total Words in Reference}}WER=TotalWordsinReferenceSubstitutions+Insertions+Deletions​  
* Lower WER means better accuracy.

### **🔹 Character Error Rate (CER)**

* Useful for languages with complex word structures (e.g., Chinese, Arabic).  
* Similar to WER but operates at the character level instead of words.

### **🔹 Speaker Diarization Accuracy**

* Evaluates how well the system differentiates speakers in multi-speaker audio.  
* Important for meetings, interviews, and legal transcriptions.

### **🔹 Processing Time per Audio Minute**

* Measures efficiency in transcribing an audio file.  
* Formula: Processing Time=Total Time TakenTotal Audio Duration\\text{Processing Time} \= \\frac{\\text{Total Time Taken}}{\\text{Total Audio Duration}}Processing Time=Total Audio DurationTotal Time Taken​  
* Faster processing time is ideal.

### **🔹 Confidence Scores**

* AI-generated probability scores indicating certainty in transcription.  
* Higher scores mean greater confidence in accuracy.

## **2️⃣ Language Translation Metrics 🌍**

These metrics evaluate the translation system's accuracy and performance.

### **🔹 BLEU Score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**

* Compares AI translations to human translations.  
* Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  
* A BLEU score of **70+** is considered high quality.

### **🔹 METEOR Score (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)**

* Similar to BLEU but also considers synonyms and recall.  
* More accurate for human-like translations.

### **🔹 Translation Latency**

* Measures how long it takes to translate text.  
* Formula: Latency=Processing TimeText Length\\text{Latency} \= \\frac{\\text{Processing Time}}{\\text{Text Length}}Latency=Text LengthProcessing Time​  
* Lower latency \= faster response.

### **🔹 Perplexity**

* Evaluates how well a language model predicts translations.  
* Lower perplexity means the model makes fewer errors.

### **🔹 Language Coverage**

* Tracks the number of supported languages and usage per language.  
* Helps monitor demand for different translations.

## **3️⃣ Automatic Case Triage Metrics 🏥**

These metrics evaluate how well the system classifies and manages cases.

### **🔹 Case Classification Accuracy**

* Measures the percentage of cases assigned to the correct category.  
* Higher accuracy \= better triage performance.

### **🔹 Precision, Recall & F1-score**

* **Precision**: Measures how many classified cases are actually correct.  
* **Recall**: Measures how well the system finds relevant cases.  
* **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.  
* Formula: F1=2×Precision×RecallPrecision+RecallF1 \= 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} \+ \\text{Recall}}F1=2×Precision+RecallPrecision×Recall​  
* Higher values indicate better classification.

### **🔹 Average Triage Time**

* Measures the time taken to categorize each case.  
* Faster triage improves workflow efficiency.

### **🔹 Escalation Rate**

* Tracks the percentage of cases requiring human intervention.  
* Lower escalation rate means better AI performance.

### **🔹 Case Resolution Time**

* Measures how long it takes to resolve a case.  
* Helps assess operational efficiency.

## **4️⃣ Data Science & AI Model Metrics 📈**

These metrics track overall AI model performance and reliability.

### **🔹 Model Accuracy & Loss**

* Accuracy: Measures how often the model makes correct predictions.  
* Loss: Measures how far predictions are from actual values.  
* Lower loss and higher accuracy \= better performance.

### **🔹 Precision-Recall Curve**

* Evaluates the trade-off between precision and recall.  
* Helps optimize model thresholds.

### **🔹 Data Processing Time**

* Measures how efficiently data is processed before model inference.  
* Faster processing improves system responsiveness.

### **🔹 Anomaly Detection Rate**

* Tracks how often the AI detects unusual patterns.  
* Useful for fraud detection, cybersecurity, and predictive maintenance.

### **🔹 Model Drift & Retraining Frequency**

* Model drift occurs when real-world data changes over time.  
* Tracks how often the AI needs to be retrained to stay accurate.
